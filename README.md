# Core Business

The Core Business method provides a framework to map already existing and/or planned business processes, business objects, and roles to a unified schema. The resulting [Core Business Model](Model/README.md) is the starting point for different capabilities, such as [Analysis](Analysis/README.md), [Engine](Engine/README.md), and [Simulation](Simulator/README.md).  

The very basic idea is to enable the business stakeholder to describe their workflows and tasks along the states of the core business objects. Given an typical insurance product like property & casuality as a business object. With applying the Core Business Model to this object, on a first approximation it is possible to identify three different states: 

- virtual: the abstract definition of the product
- potential: the offer provided to someone 
- real: the existing contract

Same methodology of identifying different states is possible to the other core business objects in an insurance company: persons, risks, premiums. But also other business sectors can be mapped to this methodology.
